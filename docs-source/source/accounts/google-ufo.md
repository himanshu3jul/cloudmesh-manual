# Google Account Creation Tutorial

Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning. Here at cloudmesh, we develop services through providers to support your utilization of many of these products.

This page is a step-by-step guide on how to create an Google account and then service account through the Google webpage.

## Step-by-Step Guide

* ***Step 1 - Create Google Account***  Use the following link provided by google to create a free google account. This account will provide you $300 in credits to use google cloud. https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en

* ***Step 2 - Create Project***  Go to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.

* ***Step3 - Create Service Account*** Select the newly created project and go to IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts -> Create service account to create a new service account. Select “Furnish a new private key” to create and download new private key you will use to authenticate. Opt for the new preferred JSON format, download the file and save it to a secure location. This file is referenced in the cloudmesh4.yaml in parameter "path_to_json_file" 


* `client_secret.json` 
* `google-drive-credentials.json`  

If we run the Google Drive `Provider.py` for the **First time** then the
required keys, tokens are taken from the `cloudmesh4.yaml` file and creates a
`client_secret.json` file in the follwing path `~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/`

The `Authentication.py` creates a `.credentials` folder under the following path
`~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/` if it doesn't exist and creates a
`google-drive-credentials.json` file under the following folder
`~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/.credentials/`


So, for the **First time**
browser will be opened up automatically and asks for the Google Drive(gmail)
credentials i.e., login email and  password. If you provide these 2 then
the Authentication step is completed and then it will create the 
`google-drive-credentials.json` and place it in `~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/.credentials/` folder. 
 
These steps are to be followed for the first time or initial run. Once it is
done then our program is set. After these steps then the program will run
automatically by using these credentials stored in the respective files.

## Note

The Google Drive API accepts these 2 files in the form of **.json file format**
and not in the form of a dictionary.
